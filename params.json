  "body": "## ABSTRACT\r\nThis project compares the prediction accuracies of different machine learning algorithms, for alcohol consumption level among school students. In this pursuit, three machine learning models, such as _Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Naïve-Bayes classifier_ are used on two real life data sets. Additionally, the importance of various features are deduced, that highly impact the prediction accuracy of an algorithm.\r\n\r\n## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION\r\n![flow_diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20998518/21067018/2184f420-be26-11e6-9546-a97d23f30e8a.png)\r\n\r\nRegular consumption of alcohol has adverse impacts on our physical and mental health. There are many factors that influence the drinking pattern of a person, for example, gender, upbringing, socio-economic state of the country etc. Hence, it is worthwhile to study such influencing factors, with a view to limiting the alcohol consumption of a society, at large. The challenges of this study are two-fold: (a) real life data-set containing several features that gives rise to a specific alcohol consumption level and (b) accurate mining of such data-set so as to correctly isolate the important factors that maximize the consumption. Few researchers in the past did surveys to collect the data sets, concerning the drinking pattern among teenagers. Hence, this project addresses the second challenge. This project considers two real life data sets, from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and applies three machine learning algorithms (e.g., _Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Naïve-Bayes Classifier_) to predict the alcohol consumption, subjected to various factors. The prediction accuracies are computed in terms of the average accuracy from 10-fold cross validation. Further, the features that strongly influence the alcohol consumption are extracted using _Information Gain_ analysis from a Decision Tree model.\r\n\r\n\r\n![pred_dt_mat](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20998518/21065745/2a5003d0-be1f-11e6-8ed2-c283b78c3e06.png)\r\n![pred_dt_por](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20998518/21065744/2a4c1ba8-be1f-11e6-8e6a-e69fa76e7f4d.png)\r\n![dataset](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20998518/21066843/073836fa-be25-11e6-8773-b5474ab52a9e.png)\r\n![rank](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20998518/21067142/a1435f3a-be26-11e6-8f46-1869795898c7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
